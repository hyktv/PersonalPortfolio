                Hi everyone, my name is Hafsa Mohamed and I am currently in the process of becoming a programmer at Renton Technical College. I have always loved the idea of programming as a teenager but didnt pursue it until college. It all started with a simple "Hello, World!" program that sparked a flame of curiosity within me. From that moment on, I knew i had discovered my calling.
